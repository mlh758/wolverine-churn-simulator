# wolverine-deploy-sim

A minimal, reproducible simulation of Wolverine's agent-assignment churn during
Kubernetes rolling deploys — the behavior reported in
[JasperFx/wolverine#3987](https://github.com/JasperFx/wolverine/issues/3987)
(assignment churn on every pod replacement, agents left "assigned but not
running") and its overload sibling
[#3959](https://github.com/JasperFx/wolverine/issues/3959) (no per-node
capacity ceiling, so redistribution can cascade an overload).

The companion formal model for the proposed fix lives in the Wolverine repo at
`formal/rolling-deploy/` (P model checker); this project is the empirical half:
reproduce the churn on stock Wolverine first, then rebuild with the proposal
and measure again.

## What it is

- **`src/ChurnSim`** — a .NET 9 console host using released
  `WolverineFx.Postgresql` (5.39.0) with PostgreSQL-backed durability. It
  registers a custom `IStaticAgentFamily` (`sim://agent1..N`) whose
  `EvaluateAssignmentsAsync` calls `AssignmentGrid.DistributeEvenly` — the
  same distribution the Marten projection/subscription agents use, so the
  assignment plane behaves exactly like a production critter-stack app with
  N projections. Each agent logs `AGENT-START` / `AGENT-STOP`; an optional
  `SIM_AGENT_MB` knob gives each running agent a real memory footprint for
  overload (GH-3959) scenarios.
- **`k8s/`** — a single-pod PostgreSQL and a 3-replica `churnsim` Deployment
  with a production-shaped rolling update (`maxSurge: 1`,
  `maxUnavailable: 0`, `minReadySeconds: 15`) so old pods drain while new
  pods have already joined the Wolverine cluster.
- **`scripts/`** — build/deploy, trigger a rolling deploy, and measure churn
  from the `wolverine_node_records` table plus pod logs.

## Environment setup (one time)

Podman must be installed (the native CLI, not the Desktop flatpak). Then:

```bash
# minikube as a plain user-space binary
curl -sLo ~/.local/bin/minikube \
  https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/minikube

# rootless podman driver
minikube config set rootless true
minikube start --driver=podman --container-runtime=containerd --cpus=4 --memory=6g

# kubectl comes along for free
minikube kubectl -- get nodes
```

No local .NET SDK is needed — the app builds inside the
`mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0` image.

> ⚠️ **kubectl context**: every script pins `--context=minikube` explicitly.
> Do not run bare `kubectl apply` from this repo — if your default kubeconfig
> context points at a real cluster (e.g. a production GKE context), that is
> where the manifests would land. Keep the pin if you edit the scripts.

## Running the baseline (reproduce GH-3987)

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh          # build image, load into minikube, deploy pg + 3 replicas
./scripts/reset-metrics.sh   # zero the node_records history once the cluster is settled
./scripts/rollout.sh         # one rolling deploy: 3 pods replaced one at a time
./scripts/measure.sh         # churn report
```

`measure.sh` reports:

- `wolverine_node_records` counts by event type — `AssignmentChanged` is the
  churn signal the issue reporter counted (24k rows for one 3-pod rollout in
  their production system);
- `AssignmentChanged` rows per minute, to see the churn concentrated in the
  rollout window;
- current node registrations and per-node agent assignment counts — after the
  cluster settles, every `sim://` agent should have exactly one assignment on
  a live node. Discrepancies between `wolverine_node_assignments` and what
  pods actually run are the "assigned but not running" symptom;
- `AGENT-START` / `AGENT-STOP` counts from live pod logs (note: logs of
  replaced pods are gone, so the durable node_records numbers are the source
  of truth).

To measure a steady-state baseline (no deploy), reset metrics, wait a few
minutes, and measure again — a healthy cluster should write ~zero
`AssignmentChanged` rows at rest.

## Knobs

| Knob | Where | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SIM_AGENT_COUNT` | `k8s/churnsim.yaml` | 20 | number of `sim://` agents to distribute |
| `SIM_AGENT_MB` | `k8s/churnsim.yaml` | 0 | resident MB each *running* agent allocates (for GH-3959 overload runs) |
| `replicas` | `k8s/churnsim.yaml` | 3 | cluster size |
| memory `limits` | `k8s/churnsim.yaml` | 512Mi | the OOM kill-line for overload scenarios |
| `HealthCheckPollingTime` / `CheckAssignmentPeriod` | `Program.cs` | 2s / 5s | tightened from 10s/30s so a short rollout spans several control-plane cycles |

## Results

*(filled in as runs complete)*

### Baseline: stock Wolverine 5.39.0, one rolling deploy

- TBD

## Phase 2 (planned)

Rebuild the image against a locally patched Wolverine implementing the
proposal (stability-gated rebalance + node-side assigned-vs-running reconcile
+ per-node capacity ceiling with shed), rerun the same scripts, compare the
tables. See `formal/rolling-deploy/README.md` in the Wolverine repo for the
verified design.
